            Hi, my name is Fahlevi I am a front-end web developer, iâ€™m 23 years
            old. I got a bachelor of Informatics Engineering at Universitas
            Islam Kebangsaan Indonesia(2018-2023),
            <br /> My journey in the world of web development has led me to
            specialize in cutting-edge technologies, with a strong foundation in
            Next.js and React on the frontend and Laravel on the backend. <br />
            In the realm of frontend development, I have honed my skills in
            creating dynamic and user-friendly interfaces using Next.js and
            React. I thrive on turning ideas into interactive experiences,
            whether it&rsquo;s building responsive web applications, optimizing
            website performance, or creating seamless user interfaces. I believe
            in staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best
            practices to ensure that the digital solutions I craft are not only
            visually stunning but also highly efficient and user-focused
